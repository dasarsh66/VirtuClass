## Development Documentation for VirtuClass:  

### How to get the code?  
The original source is available through the mail of our team members:  
Mr. Gilad Baruchian, Mr. Oshri Ben-Moshe, Mr. Ilay Zeidman, Mr. Raz Cohen and Mr. Yogev Gershon.  
In addition the source code is available in the project page in the repository.

### Locate information about a directory structure and files?  
There are documentations in the classes about each variable, function and class  
and in our very user friendly wiki page.  

### How to compile the project?  
Our project is built with java language, therefore you can download the code and compile it with the regular eclipse© software compiler.  

### How to prepare a new version?  
Each time a new version is released it will be published in a new folder with the new version number, and its updates.  
The new version is supposed to solve all the bugs that were found on the earlier releases (which you can find on our Bugs Reports).  

### How to get list of bugs and how to get assignments to work on the bug?

### Project License:
Our project license will be GNU GPL-General Public License , The GPL is the first copyleft license for general use, which means that derived works can only be distributed under the same license terms.  
Under this philosophy, the GPL grants the recipients of a computer program the rights of the free software definition and uses copyleft to ensure the freedoms are preserved, even when the work is changed or added to.  
This is in distinction to permissive free software licenses, of which the BSD licenses are the standard examples.  

### Project design:
We'll divide folders building into four layers:  
1) The _GUI interface_ which will provide the actual access to the the system.The GUI contains all the software that the user activates by using events.  
2) the _network layer_ that will contain class that will provide all the functionality of the chat regarding the network communication.  
3) The _editor logic_ is structured by a few classes that will manage the editor functionality.  
4) The _database integration_ will contain: class that will manage the communication and data transferring between the software to the database.  

### Project Testing:  
We will prepare testing package for each interaction so that the tests will characterized by the wanted functionality that sated for that specific interaction.  
In every interaction will perform the unit testing so we can check the MFF-main flow functionality and farther more will perform the system testing that will scheduled for that same interaction and will take place at the same time as the development process.  
The testing package will mainly involve MFF testing & due to the possible schedule will combine advanced & negative testing and mainly at the middle of the project.
